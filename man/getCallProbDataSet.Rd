\usage{
getCallProbDataSet(data, numCores, price.seq.start, price.seq.end,
  start.DateTime, end.DateTime, tarif, direction)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{- the data.frame with the calculated marginal workprices from the approximated 1min calls (@seealso getMarginalWorkPrices)}

\item{numCores}{- set the number of cores to be used for parallel computation}

\item{price.seq.start}{- specifies the start price of a price range for which call probabilities should be calculated}

\item{price.seq.end}{- specifies the end price of a price range for which call probabilities should be calculated}

\item{start.DateTime}{- specifies the start date of a time period for which call probabilities should be calculated}

\item{end.DateTime}{- specifies the end date of a time period for which call probabilities should be calculated}

\item{tarif}{- name the Tarif ("HT" or "NT") for which call probabilities should be calculated. In combination with the Direction variable this specifies the product type.}

\item{direction}{- name the Direction ("POS" or "NEG") for which call probabilities should be calculated. In combination with the Tarif variable this specifies the product type.}
}
\value{
an array with all the call probabilities of the specified timeperiod and price range.
}
\description{
This functions calculates for each price within a given price range the call probability specified on a time period and product type (Tarif and Direction).
Be aware that undefined time periods and/or Tarifs and Directions can lead to and error/exception which is not handled. So be sure that the time period and Tarif and Direction is valid/exist within the given input data.frame.
