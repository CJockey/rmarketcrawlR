}
\description{
This function is the production method of @seealso getOperatingReserveAuctions in the @seealso scrapeData.R script. It is without console prints for faster computation and several steps are combined.
This main function retrieves the operating reserve auction results from \url{https://www.regelleistung.net/ext/tender/}.
The data contains all auctions from a given start date till an end date. Be aware of the weekly data and take care of the latest week.
Variables in the returned data.frame:  - power_price (numeric). The signed power price of the bid. Point as decimal delimiter.
                                       - work_price (numeric). The signed work price of the bid. Point as decimal delimiter. There are also negative prices.
                                       - offered_power_MW (numeric). The offered power in MW. Point as decimal delimiter. 5 as the minimal bid. This will be changed someday to smaller increments.
                                       - Tarif (char). Contains the value of either "HT", the main tarif or "NT", for the remaining time periods.
                                       - Direction (char). Contains the value of either "POS", for positive operating reserve power, or "NEG" for negative power.
                                       - date_from (Date). Date object in Y-m-d format. The two date variables build the one week auction time period. This will be changed someday.
                                       - date_to (Date). Date object in Y-m-d format. The two date variables build the one week auction time period. This will be changed someday.
